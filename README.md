# CSE Code-With Customer/Partner Engineering Playbook

An engineer working for a [CSE](./CSE.md) project...

* Has responsibilities to their team â€“ mentor, coach, and lead.
* Knows their **playbook**. Follows their playbook. Fixes their playbook if it is broken. If they find a better playbook, they copy it. If somebody could use your playbook, give them yours.
* Leads by example. Models the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically (this is what most people think of as a "developer").
* Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures the outcome.

This is the playbook. You are invited to contribute via standard git pull requests to GitHub.
